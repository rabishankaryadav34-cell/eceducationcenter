# Education Center — अध्यापन अनुमतिपत्र (Teaching License) तयारी

A Nepali-language single-page site for a Teaching License exam preparation center, built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features
- Sticky header navigation (Nepali)
- Hero section with exam prep call to action
- Features cards (expert trainers, daily online tests, notes/PDFs)
- Interactive 10-question MCQ mock test with instant scoring (client-side)
- Admission form powered by **Netlify Forms** (with honeypot spam protection)
- Contact section and thank-you page

## Run locally
Open `index.html` directly in a browser, or serve the folder:

```bash
npx serve .
```

Deploying to Netlify automatically registers the `admission` form (detected from HTML at build time). Submissions appear in the Netlify UI under Forms.

## Structure
- `index.html` — the full site (styles inline, quiz logic inline)
- `thank-you.html` — post-submission redirect target
